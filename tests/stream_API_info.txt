Title:
14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible

Description:
In 2019, Nepalese mountain climber Nirmal “Nims” Purja set out to do the
unthinkable by climbing the world’s fourteen highest summits in less than seven
months. (The previous record was eight years). He called the effort “Project
Possible 14/7” and saw it as a way to inspire others to strive for greater
heights in any pursuit. The film follows his team as they seek to defy naysayers
and push the limits of human endurance.
