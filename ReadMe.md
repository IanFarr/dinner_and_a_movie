## Background

The app will help users make decisions on both what movie/show to watch and what
type of food to order.

Users will be able to input the streaming services which they subscribe to and
this will be used to randomly recommend a movie/show for them to watch. The
users location will also be used to provide food recomendations for nearby
restaurants.

Further features will allow users to narrow the recommendations by providing
selective criteria such as film genre and critical ratings. Food recommendations
can also be narrowed by type and price.
